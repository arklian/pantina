Our goal was to improve the user experience with additional capabilities so that the platform could function as an alternative to VSCode. I focused on enhancing the presence of remote users by implementing 5 new features, such as displaying usernames and adding uniquely colored cursors. Previously, users can see that someone joined their collaborative session but not know who it was. Now with these new features, remote users could be easily identified, creating a more collaborative environment.",
