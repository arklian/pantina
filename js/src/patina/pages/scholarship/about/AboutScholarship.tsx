The Scholarship amounts to $500 for one student for the fiscal year of 2024. Patina Network Scholarship has a special focus on supporting AANHPI students who would benefit the most financially; are in the first generation of their family to attend college; are representative of the AANHPI communityâ€™s diversity, either geographically or ethnically, especially those ethnicities that have been underrepresented on college campuses due to limited access and opportunity. Strong applicants would also show an emphasis on community service, leadership, and academic achievement.'
