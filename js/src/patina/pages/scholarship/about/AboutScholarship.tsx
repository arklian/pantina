Scholarship amounts to $500 for 1 (one) student for the fiscal year of 2024. Patina Network Scholarship has a special focus on supporting AANHPI students who would benefit the most financially; are in the first generation of their family to attend college; are representative of the AANHPI communityâ€™s diversity, (geographically and ethnically}, especially those ethnicities that have been underrepresented on college campuses due to limited access and opportunity. Strong applicants would also have an emphasis on community service, leadership, and academic achievement.'
