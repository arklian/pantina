      "message": "nit: this is apparently not within the scope of the pr, since images shouldn\u0027t be hosted on the repo itself, but you generally want to have images compressed to a reasonable size. \n\n~10MiB is quite large for an image that I assume will be cropped or shrunk on the website itself. Do you need the full 4096x3072? Perhaps this could be compressed to something manageable under 1MiB.\n\nImagine if you opened a website with dozens of images of this size. That\u0027s a lot of bandwidth.",
